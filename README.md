## Background
While much of the enterprise IT world is pushing HTML5 and cloud-based applications, many businesses are still using desktop UI frameworks like JavaFX. While it does not distribute to large audiences as easily as web applications, JavaFX works well for "in-house" business applications. Its high-performance with large datasets (and the fact it is native Java) make it a practical choice for applications used behind the corporate firewall.

TornadoFX was created by Edvin Syse, who leveraged Kotlin to create a framework for JavaFX.  Kotlin allowed for higher abstractions so that there is significantly less boilerplate in the user-interaction portion of the code.
